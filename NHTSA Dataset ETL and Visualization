In this project I processed and analyzed NHTSA vehicle complaint data using the Microsoft Azure cloud ecosystem. 
I ingested and transformed TXT files into partitioned .parquet format using Azure Data Factory, 
stored the data in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 instance, and built Power BI dashboards to visualize accident/fatality rates.

Below are some images of the process results, and the final dashboard of the project.
